# A multi-UAV system for coverage path planning applications with in-flight re-planning capabilities
This repository is part of **Aerostack2**[[1]](#1), and contains the code for the Powell **BINPAT**[[2]](#2).  method for planning multi-area coverage trajectories with multiple UAVs. Its main contribution is the control architecture that allows estimating the status of the mission through monitoring the status of the aircraft; so that if an aircraft is lost during the flight, the system replans the mission with the remaining aircraft and completes the flight.
Details of this approach are found in [[3]](#3).
Additionally, the configuration has been uploaded for testing in simulated environments in Gazebo, and real environments using Crazyfly UAVs and the Optitrack motion capture system.
